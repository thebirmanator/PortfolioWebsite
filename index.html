                <h1>Welcome!</h1>
                <p>Hello! My name is TheBirmanator, and welcome to my portfolio website. I showcase all of my most significant, large, complex, or interesting projects 
                    here for the world to see. Whether you are a casual computer clicker, who&#39;s here simply to take a peek, or an important business(wo)man looking for a competent programmer, 
                    I hope you enjoy your stay.
                </p>
                <p>For real though, I am trying to make a decent living off of my passion. If you are here looking to commission, look no further for that contact button, 
                    or continue scrolling to view my wonderful work.
                </p>

                                <h3>Paintball</h3>
                                <p>Paintball is my largest project to date. It is a minigame used for our server, 
                                    and was started in May of 2018. It has its own custom events and listeners, scoreboards, and custom configuration files. 
                                    It is meant to be completely user-friendly; owners can configure and use this plugin without having any knowledge of how it works, 
                                    and it&#39;s meant to handle exceptions gracefully. It has also grown a lot from staff and player feedback, which is why it&#39;s still being updated to this day.
                                </p>

                                <p>This is my most technical project, using my most advanced knowledge of Java. It is meant for people to easily add onto it. 
                                    Want to make a new myth appear in the game? This plugin is designed to do that with just a couple new classes; it handles everything else! 
                                    It&#39;s also designed for public use, so anyone who doesn&#39;t know how to program can easily configure it and use its commands.

                                <p>This is my first real HTML/CSS project. Before, I had only done a few small websites in school that never went live. 
                                    I&#39;ve been wanting to expand my horizons from Java, and web development seems very useful and interesting. 
                                    I&#39;ve picked up many new things that were never touched upon in school, especially with divs, and I&#39;ve even gotten to integrate some JavaScript in there.

                <h1>Notable Projects</h1>
                <p>Here, you can see the work I&#39;ve done over the past year and continue to update!</p>
                <p>In the time I&#39;ve been programming, I&#39;ve spent the most time with Java, since it is used in the development of Minecraft plugins. 
                    However, I&#39;ve also done some Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in school, as well as for this website(except Python).</p>
                <p>In any languages, I&#39;ve picked up some useful knowledge that goes beyond one, such as how computers read code from top to bottom, 
                    and jump around only when specifically told to, how for loops repeat code multiple times, and how annoying it is when I accidentally create an infinite while loop. 
                    However, the most important lesson I&#39;ve learnt in programming is that most tasks can be done many ways. One of the most satisfying points of programming is finding 
                    the best way to do what I want, especially when it isn&#39;t my first idea, or when it leads into learning something new in the language. As a young adult trying to find 
                    her way in the world, I also think about this when I&#39;m not sure how to go about something, or if I&#39;m afraid of doing it “wrong.”</p>
                <p>This aspiration to find better ways to complete tasks has led to many projects, which you can see and enjoy below!</p>

                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I am a 19 year old aspiring developer who got her true start in Minecraft. Though I did some programming and computer science classes in high school, 
                        I did not realise my passion until I started creating Minecraft plugins with a few friends, and eventually started to use and create more for a server with players, 
                        who would see and use them. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Knowing my passion lies in the computer sciences and that Minecraft won&#39;t live forever, at least in the state it&#39;s in right now, 
                        I&#39;ve decided to expand my knowledge and practice new languages, or ones I haven&#39;t worked with in a while. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Right now, programming is just a passion that hasn&#39;t taken off yet, so I work at Subway to make a living. 
                        Though it is a menial job that I hope to get out of this year, it has taught me valuable social lessons, such as how to deal with irritated customers or unhappy bosses, 
                        which cause a great deal of stress, and how to interact with people in a polite manner and create light conversation. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I also have many interests outside of my work life. I enjoy studying Japanese and language in general because it fascinates me how different cultures construct the same thoughts, 
                        ideas, and words differently. I also exercise at the gym regularly to keep my body in shape, and I take interest in writing my own fictional novel and singing.
